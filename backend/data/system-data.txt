AGRIHUB-LK: OFFICIAL SYSTEM KNOWLEDGE BASE & USER GUIDE
======================================================

1. SYSTEM OVERVIEW
System Name: AgriHUB-LK
Purpose: A comprehensive agricultural supply chain platform connecting Farmers, Distributors, and Transporters in Sri Lanka to streamline crop sales and logistics.

2. USER ROLES & PERMISSIONS
The system uses strict Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Users can only perform actions assigned to their specific role:
- Admin: Manages the entire platform. Can view all users, delete malicious accounts, and send targeted system notifications.
- Farmer: The primary suppliers. Once their email is verified, Farmers can add new crops to the marketplace, manage their product inventory, and view incoming orders.
- Distributor: The buyers. Distributors can browse the marketplace, purchase crops from Farmers, and track their supply orders.
- Transporter: The logistics partners. Transporters manage delivery vehicles and accept delivery jobs to move crops from Farmers to Distributors.

3. ACCOUNT SECURITY & MANAGEMENT
- Email Verification: New accounts must be verified before performing core actions (like a Farmer adding a crop). Users must request a verification OTP, which sends a 6-digit code to their email. The code expires in 10 minutes.
- Forgot Password: If a user forgets their password, they can request a reset OTP from the login page. A 6-digit code will be emailed to them, which expires in 15 minutes.
- Profile Updates: Users can update their personal details (like Full Name and Phone Number) at any time from their Profile Dashboard. 
- Password Updates: Passwords cannot be changed directly from the profile update screen for security reasons; users must use the official password reset flow.
- Account Deletion: Users have the right to permanently delete their own account from the Profile Dashboard.

4. NOTIFICATION SYSTEM
- Receiving Messages: Users receive direct, individualized notifications in their inbox. Clicking a notification marks it as "Read".
- Admin Broadcasts: Admins can send bulk notifications filtered by User Role (e.g., only Farmers) and Verification Status (e.g., only Unverified users). 
- Notification Security: Once a user has marked a notification as "Read", Admins cannot edit or alter the message.
